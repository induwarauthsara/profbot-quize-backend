Note that this code assumes that you have created a database named "quiz_app" with two tables: "quiz_questions" and "quiz_results". The "quiz_questions" table should have the following columns: "id", "question", "correct_answer", "wrong_answer_1", "wrong_answer_2", "wrong_answer_3", and "time_limit". The "quiz_results" table should have the following columns: "id" and "user_answer".
